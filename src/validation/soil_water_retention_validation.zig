//! Independent physical-invariant and convergence evidence for the intentional
//! replacement of the HOUR1 three-branch log-log matric water potential
//! (`ecosys_f77/hour1.f` lines 4107--4170) by the original Mualem--van
//! Genuchten retention curve in `retention.zig`.
//!
//! Why this file exists. `docs/model_changes.md` ("Improved hydrology and
//! freeze-thaw") records the replacement, and `docs/validation.md` states that
//! "legacy output match is not sufficient for intentional replacement
//! formulations". Legacy agreement therefore can never validate this change:
//! the two formulations are different constitutive relations and are *expected*
//! to disagree. The `hour1.f` ledger row consequently asks for the
//! physical-invariant comparison and the convergence study instead. This module
//! is that evidence, organised by `docs/validation.md` tier.
//!
//! - Tier 1, dimensional consistency and valid physical domains:
//!   `retentionDomain` over every USDA texture class.
//! - Tier 2, conservation and balance closure: `capacityClosureResidual`
//!   verifies the constitutive identity `integral C(h) dh == dtheta` that makes
//!   the curve admissible in a Richards mass balance at all.
//! - Tier 3, analytical solutions: the `n = 2` closed forms of both the
//!   retention and the Mualem conductivity integral.
//! - Tier 4, controlled process benchmarks: Carsel--Parrish plant-available
//!   water by texture, against published ranges.
//! - Tier 6, grid/timestep/tolerance convergence: `midpointClosureOrder`
//!   measures the observed convergence order of the capacity integral, and the
//!   retention fit is refined across seven decades of tolerance.
//!
//! The tier 2 and tier 6 instruments are the substance of the comparison. They
//! are applied to *both* formulations, which is what makes the comparison a
//! physical-invariant one rather than a numerical-agreement one: the legacy
//! curve's water capacity `C = dtheta/dh` is discontinuous at field capacity
//! and at the wilting point, because each of its three branches is a separate
//! power law joined only in value and not in slope. A discontinuous `C` is not
//! a defect of the legacy *code*; it is a property of the legacy *formulation*,
//! and it degrades any quadrature or Newton linearisation that crosses the
//! joint to first order. The van Genuchten curve is continuously differentiable
//! on the whole unsaturated range and retains second order there. That is an
//! independent, measurable, legacy-free reason to prefer the replacement.
//!
//! Nothing here mutates production state; this module has no `applyTile` and is
//! imported only for its tests.
